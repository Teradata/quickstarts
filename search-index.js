Adam Tworkiewicz Last updated: December 28st, 2021 This tutorial demonstrates how to use dbt (Data Build Tool) with Teradata Vantage. It’s based on the original dbt Jaffle Shop tutorial. A couple of models have been adjusted to the SQL dialect supported by Vantage. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a new instance of Vantage the easiest way is to install Vantage Express on your local machine using VMware or VirtualBox. Python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 installed. Clone the tutorial repository and cd into the project directory: git clone git@github.com:Teradata/jaffle_shop-dev.git jaffle_shop cd jaffle_shop Create a new python environment to manage dbt and its dependencies. Activate the environment: python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate Install dbt-teradata module and its dependencies. The core dbt module is included as a dependency so you don’t have to install it separately: pip install dbt-teradata We will now configure dbt to connect to your Vantage database. Create file $HOME/.dbt/profiles.yml with the following content. Adjust , , to match your Teradata instance. jaffle_shop: outputs: dev: type: teradata host: user: password: logmech: TD2 schema: jaffle_shop tmode: ANSI threads: 1 timeout_seconds: 300 priority: interactive retries: 1 target: dev Now, that we have the profile file in place, we can validate the setup: dbt debug If the debug command returned errors, you likely have an issue with the content of profiles.yml. jaffle_shop is a fictional e-commerce store. This dbt project transforms raw data from an app database into a dimensional model with customer and order data ready for analytics. The raw data from the app consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the following entity-relationship diagram: dbt takes these raw data table and builds the following dimensional model, which is more suitable for analytics tools: In real life, we will be getting raw data from platforms like Segment, Stitch, Fivetran or another ETL tool. In our case, we will use dbt’s seed functionality to create tables from csv files. The csv files are located in ./data directory. Each csv file will produce one table. dbt will inspect the files and do type inference to decide what data types to use for columns. Let’s create the raw data tables: dbt seed You should now see 3 tables in your jaffle_shop database: raw_customers, raw_orders, raw_payments. The tables should be populated with data from the csv files. Now that we have the raw tables, we can instruct dbt to create the dimensional model: dbt run So what exactly happened here? dbt created additional tables using CREATE TABLE/VIEW FROM SELECT SQL. In the first transformation, dbt took raw tables and built denormalized join tables called customer_orders, order_payments, customer_payments. You will find the definitions of these tables in ./marts/core/intermediate. In the second step, dbt created dim_customers and fct_orders tables. These are the dimensional model tables that we want to expose to our BI tool. dbt applied multiple transformations to our data. How can we ensure that the data in the dimensional model is correct? dbt allows us to define and execute tests against the data. The tests are defined in ./marts/core/schema.yml. The file describes each column in all relationships. Each column can have multiple tests configured under tests key. For example, we expect that fct_orders.order_id column will contain unique, non-null values. To validate that the data in the produced tables satisfies the test conditions run: dbt test Our model consists of just a few tables. Imagine a scenario where where we have many more sources of data and a much more complex dimensional model. We could also have an intermediate zone between the raw data and the dimensional model that follows the Data Vault 2.0 principles. Would it not be useful, if we had the inputs, transformations and outputs documented somehow? dbt allows us to generate documentation from its configuration files: dbt docs generate This will produce html files in ./target directory. You can start your own server to browse the documentation. The following command will start a server and open up a browser tab with the docs' landing page: dbt docs serve This tutorial demonstrated how to use dbt with Teradata Vantage. The sample project takes raw data and produces a dimensional data mart. We used multiple dbt commands to populate tables from csv files (dbt seed), create models (dbt run), test the data (dbt test), and generate and serve model documentation (dbt docs generate, dbt docs serve). dbt documentation dbt-teradata plugin documentation Did this page help?","title":"dbt with Teradata Vantage","component":"ROOT","version":"current","name":"dbt","url":"/current/dbt.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","id":"_overview"},{"text":"Prerequsites","id":"_prerequsites"},{"text":"Install dbt","id":"_install_dbt"},{"text":"Configure dbt","id":"_configure_dbt"},{"text":"About the Jaffle Shop warehouse","id":"_about_the_jaffle_shop_warehouse"},{"text":"Run dbt","id":"_run_dbt"},{"text":"Create raw data tables","id":"_create_raw_data_tables"},{"text":"Create the dimensional model","id":"_create_the_dimensional_model"},{"text":"Test the data","id":"_test_the_data"},{"text":"Generate documentation","id":"_generate_documentation"},{"text":"Summary","id":"_summary"},{"text":"Further reading","id":"_further_reading"}]},"/current/fastload.html":{"text":"Author: Adam Tworkiewicz Last updated: October 21st, 2021 We often have a need to move large volumes of data into Vantage. The quickest way to do that is using Fastload mode from Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT). This how-to demonstrates how to use Fastload. In this scenario, we will load over 300k records, over 40MB of data, in a couple of seconds. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a new instance of Vantage the easiest way is to install Vantage Express on your local machine using VMware or VirtualBox. Download Teradata Tools and Utilities (TTU) - supported platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (requires registration). Windows MacOS Linux Unzip the downloaded file and run setup.exe. Unzip the downloaded file and run TeradataToolsAndUtilitiesXX.XX.XX.pkg. Unzip the downloaded file, go to the unzipped directory and run: ./setup.sh a We will be working with the US tax fillings for nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit tax filings are public data. The US Internal Revenue Service publishes them in S3 bucket. Let’s grab a summary of filings for 2020: https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2020.csv. You can use your browser, wget or curl to save the file locally. Let’s create a database in Vantage. Use you favorite SQL tool to run: CREATE DATABASE irs AS PERMANENT = 120e6, -- 120MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB We will now run Fastload. Fastload is a command-line tool that is very efficient in uploading large amounts of data into Vantage. Fastload, in order to be fast, has several restrictions in place. It can only populate empty tables, no inserts to already populated tables are supported. It doesn’t support tables with secondary indices. Also, it won’t insert duplicate records, even if a table is a MULTISET table. For the full list of restrictions check out Teradata® FastLoad Reference. Fastload has its own scripting language. The language allows you to prepare the database with arbitrary SQL commands, declare the input source and define how the data should be inserted into Vantage. The tool supports both interactive and batch mode. In this section, we are going to use the interactive mode. Let’s start Fastload in the interactive mode: fastload First, let’s log in to a Vantage database. I’ve a Vantage Express running locally, so I’ll use localhost as the hostname and dbc for username and password: LOGON localhost/dbc,dbc; Now, that we are logged in, I’m going to prepare the database. I’m switching to irs database and making sure that the target table irs_returns and error tables (more about error tables later) do not exist: DATABASE irs; DROP TABLE irs_returns; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err1; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err2; I’ll now create an empty table that can hold the data elements from the csv file. CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns ( return_id INT, filing_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, ein INT, tax_period INT, sub_date VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, taxpayer_name VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, return_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, dln BIGINT, object_id BIGINT ) PRIMARY INDEX ( return_id ); Now, that the target table has been prepared, we can start loading the data. ERRORFILES directive defines error files. The error files are really tables that TPT creates. The first table contains information about data conversion and other issues. The second table keeps track of data uniqueness issues, e.g. primary key violations. BEGIN LOADING irs_returns ERRORFILES irs_returns_err1, irs_returns_err2; We instruct TPT to save a checkpoint every 10k rows. It’s useful in case we have to restart our job. It will be able to resume from the last checkpoint. CHECKPOINT 10000; We also need to tell TPT to skip the first row in the CSV file as start at record 2. That’s because the first row contains column headers. RECORD 2; TPT also needs to know that it’s a comma-separated file: SET RECORD VARTEXT \",\"; DEFINE block specifies what columns we should expect: DEFINE in_return_id (VARCHAR(19)), in_filing_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_ein (VARCHAR(19)), in_tax_period (VARCHAR(19)), in_sub_date (VARCHAR(22)), in_taxpayer_name (VARCHAR(100)), in_return_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_dln (VARCHAR(19)), in_object_id (VARCHAR(19)), DEFINE block also has FILE attribute that points to the file with the data. Replace FILE = /tmp/index_2020.csv; with your location of index_2020.csv file: FILE = /tmp/index_2020.csv; Finally, we define the INSERT statement that will put data into the database and we close off LOADING block: INSERT INTO irs_returns ( return_id, filing_type, ein, tax_period, sub_date, taxpayer_name, return_type, dln, object_id ) VALUES ( :in_return_id, :in_filing_type, :in_ein, :in_tax_period, :in_sub_date, :in_taxpayer_name, :in_return_type, :in_dln, :in_object_id ); END LOADING; Once the job has finished, we are logging off from the database to clean things up. LOGOFF; Here is what the entire script looks like: LOGON localhost/dbc,dbc; DATABASE irs; DROP TABLE irs_returns; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err1; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err2; CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns ( return_id INT, filing_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, ein INT, tax_period INT, sub_date VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, taxpayer_name VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, return_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, dln BIGINT, object_id BIGINT ) PRIMARY INDEX ( return_id ); BEGIN LOADING irs_returns ERRORFILES irs_returns_err1, irs_returns_err2; CHECKPOINT 10000; RECORD 2; SET RECORD VARTEXT \",\"; DEFINE in_return_id (VARCHAR(19)), in_filing_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_ein (VARCHAR(19)), in_tax_period (VARCHAR(19)), in_sub_date (VARCHAR(22)), in_taxpayer_name (VARCHAR(100)), in_return_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_dln (VARCHAR(19)), in_object_id (VARCHAR(19)), FILE = /tmp/index_2020.csv; INSERT INTO irs_returns ( return_id, filing_type, ein, tax_period, sub_date, taxpayer_name, return_type, dln, object_id ) VALUES ( :in_return_id, :in_filing_type, :in_ein, :in_tax_period, :in_sub_date, :in_taxpayer_name, :in_return_type, :in_dln, :in_object_id ); END LOADING; LOGOFF; To run our example in batch mode, simply save all instructions in a single file and run: fastload < file_with_instruction.fastload In our case, the file is in an S3 bucket. That means, that we can use Native Object Storage (NOS) to ingest the data: -- create an S3-backed foreign table CREATE FOREIGN TABLE irs_returns_nos USING ( LOCATION('/s3/s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2020.csv') ); -- load the data into a native table CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns_nos_native (RETURN_ID, FILING_TYPE, EIN, TAX_PERIOD, SUB_DATE, TAXPAYER_NAME) AS ( SELECT RETURN_ID, FILING_TYPE, EIN, TAX_PERIOD, SUB_DATE, TAXPAYER_NAME FROM irs_returns_nos ) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; The NOS solution is convenient as it doesn’t depend on additional tools. It can be implemented using only SQL. Fastload is still a better solution if we are after raw performance. This how-to demonstrated how to ingest large amounts of data into Vantage. We loaded hundreds of thousands or records into Vantage in a couple of seconds using Fastload mode from Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT).

There are a couple of ways to connect to Vantage from a Jupyter Notebook: Use python or R libraries in a regular Python/R kernel notebook - this option works well when you are in a restricted environment that doesn’t allow you to spawn your own Docker images. Also, it’s useful in traditional datascience scenarios when you have to mix SQL and Python/R in a notebook. If you are proficient with Jupyter and have your own set of preferred libraries and extensions, start with this option. Use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image - the Teradata Jupyter Docker image bundles the Teradata SQL kernel (more on this later), teradataml and tdplyr libraries, python and R drivers. It also contains Jupyter extensions that allow you to manage Teradata connections, explore objects in Vantage database. It’s convenient when you work a lot with SQL or would find a visual Navigator helpful. If you are new to Jupyter or if you prefer to get a currated assembly of libraries and extensions, start with this option. This option uses a regular Jupyter Lab notebook. We will see how to load the Teradata Python driver and use it from Python code. We will also examine ipython-sql extension that adds support for SQL-only cells. We start with a plain Jupyter Lab notebook. Here, I’m using docker but any method of starting a notebook, including Jupyter Hub, GCP AI Platform Notebooks, AWS SageMaker Notebooks, Azure ML Notebooks will do. docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes \\ -v \"${PWD}\":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/datascience-notebook Docker logs will display the url that you need to go to: Starting JupyterLab ...

Since I’m running my notebook in Docker on my local machine and I want to connect to a local Vantage Express VM, I’m using host.docker.internal DNS name provided by Docker to reference the IP of my machine. import pandas as pd db_connection_string = \"teradatasql://dbc:dbc@host.docker.internal/dbc\" I can now call Pandas to query Vantage and move the result to a Pandas dataframe: pd.read_sql(\"SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo\", con = db_connection_string) The syntax above is concise but it can get tedious if all you need is to explore data in Vantage. We will use ipython-sql and its %%sql magic to create SQL-only cells. We start with importing the required libraries. import sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install ipython-sql teradatasqlalchemy We load ipython-sql and define the db connection string: %load_ext sql %sql teradatasql://dbc:dbc@host.docker.internal/dbc We can now use %sql and %%sql magic. Let’s say we want to explore data in a table. We can create a cell that says: %%sql SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo If we want to move the data to a Pandas frame, we can say: result = %sql SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo result.DataFrame() There are many other features that ipython-sql provides, including variable substitution, plotting with matplotlib, writting results to a local csv file or back to the database. See the demo notebook for examples and ipython-sql github repo for a complete reference. The Teradata Jupyter Docker image builds on jupyter/datascience-notebook Docker image. It adds the Teradata SQL kernel, Teradata Python and R libraries, Jupyter extensions to make you productive while interacting with Teradata Vantage. The image also contains sample notebooks that demonstrate how to use the SQL kernel and Teradata libraries. The SQL kernel and Teradata Jupyter extensions are useful for people that spend a lot of time with the SQL interface. Think about it as a notebook experience that, in many cases, is more convenient than using Teradata Studio. The Teradata Jupyter Docker image doesn’t try to replace Teradata Studio. It doesn’t have all the features. It’s designed for people who need a lightweight, web-based interface and enjoy the notebook UI. The Teradata Jupyter Docker image can be used when you want to run Jupyter locally or you have a place where you can run custom Jupyter docker images, .e.g. JupyterHub or GCP AI Platform Notebooks, AWS SageMaker Notebooks. The steps below demonstrate how to use the image locally. Download the Teradata Vantage Modules for Jupyter docker image. If you don’t have an account with Teradata Downloads, you will need to register first. Import the image to your local registry: docker load -i teradatajupyterlabext_.tar.gz Let’s verify that the image has been imported correctly and get the name of the image. Look for teradatajupyterlabext_. Copy the image name. We will need it in the next step. docker image ls Run the image: Replace /path/to/my/directory/with/notebooks with a directory on your machine where you intend to keep notebook files. Docker must be allowed to map this directory. Also, replace teradatajupyterlabext with the image name from the previous step. docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888 \\ -v /path/to/my/directory/with/notebooks:/home/jovyan/JupyterLabRoot \\ teradatajupyterlabext Docker logs will display the url that you need to go to. For example, this is what I’ve got: Starting JupyterLab ... Docker Build ID = 3.0.0-ec03292021 Using unencrypted HTTP Enter this URL in your browser: http://localhost:8888?token=96a3ab874a03779c400966bf492fe270c2221cdcc74b61ed * Or enter this token when prompted by Jupyter: 96a3ab874a03779c400966bf492fe270c2221cdcc74b61ed * If you used a different port to run your Docker, replace 8888 with your port number Open up the URL and use the file explorer to open the following notebook: jupyterextensions → notebooks → sql → GettingStartedDemo.ipynb. Go through the demo of the Teradata SQL Kernel: This quick start covered different options to connect to Teradata Vantage from a Jupyter Notebook. We learned about the Teradata Jupyter Docker image that bundles multiple Teradata Python and R libraries. It also provides an SQL kernel, database object explorer and connection management. These features are useful when you spend a lot of time with the SQL interface. For more traditional data science scenarios, we explored the standalone Teradata Python driver and integration through the ipython sql extension.

Customize an existing Docker image to include Teradata extensions. This page contains detailed instructions on the two options. Instructions are based on the assumption that the customer JupyterHub deployment is based on Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes. Teradata provides a ready-to-run Docker image that builds on the jupyter/datascience-notebook image. It bundles the Teradata SQL kernel, Teradata Python and R libraries and drivers and Teradata extensions for Jupyter to make you productive while interacting with Teradata database. The image also contains sample notebooks that demonstrate how to use the SQL kernel, extensions and Teradata libraries. You can use this image in the following ways: Start a personal Jupyter Notebook server in a local Docker container Run JupyterLab servers for a team using JupyterHub For instructions to start a personal JupyterLab server in a local Docker container, please see installation guide. This section will focus on how to use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image in a customer’s existing JupyterHub environment. Go to Vantage Modules for Jupyter page and download the Docker image. It is a tarball with name in this format teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION.tar.gz. Load the image: docker load -i teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION.tar.gz Push the image to your Docker registry: docker push You may want to consider changing the name of the loaded image for simplicity: docker tag OLD_IMAGE_NAME NEW_IMAGE_NAME To use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image directly in your JupyterHub cluster, modify the override file as described in herein the JupyterHub documentation. Replace REGISTRY_URL and VERSION with appropriate values from the step above: singleuser: image: name: REGISTRY_URL/teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION tag: latest Apply the changes to the cluster as described in JupyterHub documentation. You can use multiple profiles to allow users to select which image they want to use when they log in to JupyterHub. For detailed instructions and examples on configuring multiple profiles, please see JupyterHub documentation. If your users need some packages or notebooks that are not bundled in the Teradata Jupyter Docker image, we recommend that you use Teradata image as a base image and build a new one on top of it. Here is an example Dockerfile that builds on top of Teradata image and adds additional packages and notebooks. Use the Dockerfile to build a new Docker image, push the image to a designated registry, modify override file as shown above to use the new image as singleuser image, apply the changes to the cluster as described above. Replace REGISTRY_URL and VERSION with appropriate values: FROM REGISTRY_URL/teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION:latest # install additional packages RUN pip install --no-cache-dir astropy # copy notebooks COPY notebooks/. /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/DemoNotebooks/ If you prefer, you can include the Teradata SQL kernel and extensions into into an existing image you are currently using. Go to Vantage Modules for Jupyter page to download the zipped Teradata Jupyter extensions package bundle. Assuming your existing docker image is Linux based, you will want to use the Linux version of the download. Otherwise, download for the platform you are using. The .zip file contains the Teradata SQL Kernel, extensions and sample notebooks. Unzip the bundle file to your working directory. Below is an example Dockerfile to add Teradata Jupyter extensions to your existing Docker image. Use the Dockerfile to build a new Docker image, push the image to a designated registry, modify override file as shown above to use the new image as singleuser image, apply the changes to the cluster: FROM REGISTRY_URL/your-existing-image:tag ENV NB_USER=jovyan \\ HOME=/home/jovyan \\ EXT_DIR=/opt/teradata/jupyterext/packages USER root ############################################################## # Install kernel and copy supporting files ############################################################## # Copy the kernel COPY ./teradatakernel /usr/local/bin RUN chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/teradatakernel # Copy directory with kernel.json file into image COPY ./teradatasql teradatasql/ ############################################################## # Switch to user jovyan to copy the notebooks and license files. ############################################################## USER $NB_USER # Copy notebooks COPY ./notebooks/ /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/TeradataSampleNotebooks/ # Copy license files COPY ./ThirdPartyLicenses /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/ThirdPartyLicenses/ USER root # Install the kernel file to /opt/conda jupyter lab instance RUN jupyter kernelspec install ./teradatasql --prefix=/opt/conda ############################################################## # Install Teradata extensions ############################################################## COPY ./teradata_*.tgz $EXT_DIR WORKDIR $EXT_DIR RUN jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_database* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_resultset* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_sqlhighlighter* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_connection_manager* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_preferences* && \\ jupyter lab build --dev-build=False --minimize=False && \\ rm -rf * WORKDIR $HOME # Give back ownership of /opt/conda to jovyan RUN chown -R jovyan:users /opt/conda # Jupyter will create .local directory RUN rm -rf $HOME/.local You can optionally install Teradata package for Python and Teradata package for R.

You have a model type in mind. You don’t want to operationalize with an ML pipeline just yet. You just want to test out if the relationship you had in mind exists. Also, sometimes even your production deployment doesn’t require constant relearning with MLops. In such cases, you can use Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and multiple ML model types it supports. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a new instance of Vantage the easiest way is to install Vantage Express on your local machine using VMware or VirtualBox. Support for ML in Vantage requires Vantage Analytics Library (VAL). In this section, we will install VAL and load some sample data. VAL is distributed as an rpm file. Go to Teradata Downloads and download the VAL rpm to your local machine. Upload the file to your Vantage install. If you are running Vantage Express locally, you have many ways to do it: If you installed Vantage Express on VirtualBox, you should be able to drag & drop the file to the VM’s desktop. You can also use scp by connecting to port 4422, e.g.: scp -P 4422 ~/Downloads/VAL-2.0.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm root@localhost:/root/Desktop If you use VMware and you have enabled drag & drop, you should be able to drag and drop the file to the VM’s desktop. If you have SSH access to your Vantage nodes, you can use scp to upload the binary, e.g.: scp ~/Downloads/VAL-2.0.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm root@vantage.server.name:/tmp/ We will now create a new database where VAL functions and procedures will be installed. You could install VAL in a global location such as SYSLIB, but installing VAL in a specific database will make it easier to start over if things go wrong. Let’s create a database called val and grant appropriate permissions to our user. Please edit to match your database name and user id: CREATE DATABASE val AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB GRANT CREATE FUNCTION ON val to dbc; GRANT ALTER FUNCTION ON val to dbc; GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE on SQLJ.REMOVE_JAR to dbc; GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE on SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR to dbc; GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE on SQLJ.REPLACE_JAR to dbc; GRANT CREATE EXTERNAL PROCEDURE ON val to dbc; Open Gnome Terminal in the VM and start the installation process. Adjust the rpm path as necessary: rpm -Uvh --nodeps ~/Desktop/VAL-2.0.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm The install wizard will ask you for the hostname, user id, and password. If you are running the install on your Vantage Express VM, the values are: Hostname: localhost Userid: dbc Password: dbc Account string: leave empty, press ENTER BTEQ or FASTLOAD command: leave empty, press ENTER The wizard will ask you to choose which part of VAL you want to install. We want to start with installing td_analyze procedure, i.e. option 1. Once you select option 1, the script will ask for the database name where td_analyze will be installed. Enter val and press ENTER. While still in the wizard, install option 5, i.e. Tutorial Tables. These are sample tables with data that we are going to use to build a sample model. Now, that we have VAL and sample tables loaded, let’s explore the data. It’s a simplistic, fictitious dataset of banking customers (1K-ish rows), Accounts (10K-ish rows) and Transactions (100K-ish rows). They are related to each other in the following ways: In later parts of this quickstart we are going to explore if we can build a model that predicts average monthly balance that a banking customer has on their credit card based on all non-credit card related variables in the tables. Let’s start by creating a wide table (Analytic Data Set, or ADS) that joins the three tables above. You must have CREATE TABLE permissions on the Database where the Vantage Analytic Library is installed. -- Switch to val database. DATABASE val; -- Create the ADS. CREATE TABLE VAL_ADS AS ( SELECT T1.cust_id AS cust_id ,MIN(T1.income) AS tot_income ,MIN(T1.age) AS tot_age ,MIN(T1.years_with_bank) AS tot_cust_years ,MIN(T1.nbr_children) AS tot_children ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.marital_status) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS single_ind ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.gender) = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS female_ind ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.marital_status) = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS married_ind ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.marital_status) = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS separated_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'CA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ca_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'NY' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ny_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'TX' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tx_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'IL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS il_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'AZ' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS az_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'OH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS oh_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CK' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ck_acct_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'SV' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sv_acct_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CC' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cc_acct_ind ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CK' THEN T2.starting_balance+T2.ending_balance ELSE 0 END) AS ck_avg_bal ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'SV' THEN T2.starting_balance+T2.ending_balance ELSE 0 END) AS sv_avg_bal ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CC' THEN T2.starting_balance+T2.ending_balance ELSE 0 END) AS cc_avg_bal ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CK' THEN T3.principal_amt+T3.interest_amt ELSE 0 END) AS ck_avg_tran_amt ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'SV' THEN T3.principal_amt+T3.interest_amt ELSE 0 END) AS sv_avg_tran_amt ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CC' THEN T3.principal_amt+T3.interest_amt ELSE 0 END) AS cc_avg_tran_amt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 1 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q1_trans_cnt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 2 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q2_trans_cnt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 3 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q3_trans_cnt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 4 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q4_trans_cnt FROM Customer AS T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN Accounts AS T2 ON T1.cust_id = T2.cust_id LEFT OUTER JOIN Transactions AS T3 ON T2.acct_nbr = T3.acct_nbr GROUP BY T1.cust_id) WITH DATA UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (cust_id); We will now build a linear regression model that takes parameters from the dataset and tries to predict the monthly credit card balance. We call td_analyze and tell it we want a linear model. The input is in table VAL_ADS and consists of multiple columns. The dependent variable is cc_avg_bal. We want the model to be written to val database in table called LINEAR_REGRESSION_DEMO: call td_analyze('linear', 'database=val; tablename=VAL_ADS; columns=tot_age,tot_income,tot_cust_years,tot_children,single_ind,female_ind,married_ind,separated_ind,ck_acct_ind,sv_acct_ind,sv_avg_bal,ck_avg_bal,ca_resident_ind,ny_resident_ind,tx_resident_ind,il_resident_ind,az_resident_ind,oh_resident_ind; dependent=cc_avg_bal; outputdatabase=val; outputtablename=linear_regression_demo'); The procedure creates several output tables. For now, we don’t have to analyze what is in the tables. Let’s see how we can use the newly created model to perform scoring. Let’s use the model to perform predictions and evaluate the scores. To do this, we call td_analyze with linearscore parameter. We point to the input table (VAL_ADS), the model tables (prefix linear_regression_demo) and define the target table (linear_regression_score) in val database: call td_analyze('linearscore', 'database=val; tablename=VAL_ADS; modeldatabase=val; modeltablename=linear_regression_demo; outputdatabase=val; outputtablename=linear_regression_score; predicted=estimate; retain=cc_avg_bal; scoringmethod=scoreandevaluate;'); As a result, we get linear_regression_score table that contains the real balance, the predicted balance and the difference between these two. Let’s have a look at a sample: SELECT * FROM linear_regression_score SAMPLE 10; You will see results similar to: cust_id|cc_avg_bal |estimate |Residual | -------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+ 1362498| 0.0| 284.7057772484358| -284.7057772484358| 1362828| 1184.35|463.74177458594215| 720.6082254140578| 1362839| 2933.135802469136| 982.9240031182255| 1950.2117993509103| 1362986| 500.9148148148148| 881.4116539412856| -380.4968391264708| 1362511|235.85941489361701|294.35369563202846|-58.494280738411426| 1363134| 0.0|430.27950420065997|-430.27950420065997| 1363481| 0.0| 411.2359958542745| -411.2359958542745| 1362644| 209.3304347826087|279.75770904482033| -70.42727426221163| 1363141| 0.0| 550.1681921045503| -550.1681921045503| 1363290| 0.0|120.35348558871233|-120.35348558871233| In this quick start we have learned how to create ML models in SQL.

The database connector is configured to extract this value and use it in this SQL query: SELECT * FROM hr.employees WHERE LastName = :lastName As you can see, we are using parameterized query with reference to the value of the parameter passed to the HTTP connector. So if the HTTP connector receives http://localhost:8081/?lastname=Smith, the SQL query will be: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = Smith The database connector instructs the database server to run the SQL query, retrieves the result of the query, and passes it to the Transform message processor which converts the result to JSON.

It’s useful in scenarios where you want to explore data without building a data pipeline to bring it into Vantage. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. NOS is enabled in all Vantage editions from Vantage Express through Developer, DYI to Vantage as a Service starting from version 17.10. If you need a new instance of Vantage the easiest way is to install Vantage Express on your local machine.

You want to explore the dataset before you decide if you want to bring it into Vantage. For this scenario, we are going to use a public dataset published by Teradata that contains river flow data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. The bucket is at https://td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/. Let’s first have a look at sample CSV data. We take the first 10 rows that Vantage will fetch from the bucket: SELECT TOP 10 payload..* FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' ) AS d; Here is what I’ve got: Payload..* ------------------------------------------------------------------ [\"10.9\",\"15300\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-28 00:30\",\"671\",\"0.00\",\"9.80\"] [\"10.8\",\"14500\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-28 01:00\",\"673\",\"0.00\",\"9.64\"] [\"10.7\",\"14100\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-28 01:15\",\"672\",\"0.00\",\"9.56\"] [\"11.0\",\"16200\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-27 00:00\",\"669\",\"0.00\",\"9.97\"] [\"10.9\",\"15700\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-27 00:30\",\"668\",\"0.00\",\"9.88\"] [\"10.8\",\"15400\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-27 00:45\",\"672\",\"0.00\",\"9.82\"] [\"10.8\",\"15100\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-27 01:00\",\"672\",\"0.00\",\"9.77\"] [\"10.8\",\"14700\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-27 01:15\",\"672\",\"0.00\",\"9.68\"] [\"10.9\",\"16000\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-27 00:15\",\"668\",\"0.00\",\"9.93\"] [\"10.8\",\"14900\",\"09380000\",\"2018-06-28 00:45\",\"672\",\"0.00\",\"9.72\"] We have got plenty of numbers, but what do they mean? To answer this question, we will ask Vantage to detect the schema of the CSV files: SELECT * FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' RETURNTYPE='NOSREAD_SCHEMA' ) AS d; Vantage will now fetch a data sample to analyze the schema and return results: Name Datatype FileType Location --------------- ----------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- GageHeight2 decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv Flow decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv site_no int csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv datetime TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT'Y4-MM-DDBHH:MI' csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv Precipitation decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv GageHeight decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv We see that the CSV files have 6 columns. For each column, we get the name, the datatype and the file coordinates that were used to infer the schema. Now that we know the schema, we can work with the dataset as if it was a regular SQL table. To prove the point, let’s try to do some data aggregation. Let’s get an average temperature per site for sites that collect temperatures. SELECT Payload..site_no AS Site_no, AVG(Payload..Temp) as Avg_Temp FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' ) AS d GROUP BY Payload..site_no HAVING Avg_Temp IS NOT NULL; Result: Site_no Avg_Temp -------- --------- 09380000 11 09423560 73 09424900 93 09429070 81 Note how we still have to dereference CSV columns with Payload... To make our experience more similar to a table we can define a foreign table: -- If you are running this sample as dbc user you will not have permissions -- to create a table in dbc database. Instead, create a new database and use -- the newly create database to create a foreign table. CREATE DATABASE Riverflow AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB CREATE FOREIGN TABLE Riverflow.riverflow USING ( LOCATION('/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/') ); SELECT top 10 * FROM Riverflow.riverflow; Result: Location GageHeight2 Flow site_no datetime Precipitation GageHeight ------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ---- ------- ------------------- ------------- ---------- /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09429070/2018/07/02.csv null null 9429070 2018-07-02 14:40:00 1.21 null /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 00:30:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 00:45:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 01:00:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 00:15:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09429070/2018/07/02.csv null null 9429070 2018-07-02 14:38:00 1.06 null This time, the SELECT statement looks like a regular select against an in-database table. Also, the returned data uses column names from the CSV file. No need to dereference with Payload... There is still an issue though. The query was slow. There is an easy way to bring the CSV data into Vantage to speed things up. Read on to find out how. Querying object storage takes time. What if you decided that the data looks interesting and you want to do some more analysis with a solution that will you quicker answers? The good news is that data returned with NOS can be used as a source for CREATE TABLE statements. Assuming you have CREATE TABLE privilege, you will be able to run: This query assumes you created database Riverflow and a foreign table called Riverflow.riverflow in the previous step. -- This query assumes you created database `Riverflow` -- and a foreign table called `Riverflow.riverflow` in the previous step. CREATE MULTISET TABLE Riverflow.riverflow_native(site_no, Flow, GageHeight, datetime) AS ( SELECT site_no, Flow, GageHeight, datetime FROM Riverflow.riverflow ) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Riverflow.riverflow_native; Result: site_no Flow GageHeight datetime ------- ----- ---------- ------------------- 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:30:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:00:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:15:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:30:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 02:00:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 02:15:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:45:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:45:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:15:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:00:00 This time, the SELECT query returned in less than a second. Vantage didn’t have to fetch the data from NOS. Instead, it answered using data that was already on its nodes. So far, we have used a public bucket. What if you have a private bucket? How do you tell Vantage what credentials it should use? It is possible to inline your credentials directly into your query: SELECT top 10 payload..* FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' AUTHORIZATION='{\"ACCESS_ID\":\"\",\"ACCESS_KEY\":\"\"}' ) AS d; Entering these credentials all the time can be tedious and less secure. In Vantage, you can create an authorization object that will serve as a container for your credentials: CREATE AUTHORIZATION aws_authorization USER 'YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID' PASSWORD 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY'; You can then reference your authorization object when you create a foreign table: CREATE FOREIGN TABLE Riverflow.riverflow, EXTERNAL SECURITY aws_authorization USING ( LOCATION('/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/') ); So far, we have talked about reading and importing data from object storage. Would it not be nice if we had a way to use SQL to export data from Vantage to object storage? This is exactly what WRITE_NOS function is for. Let’s say we want to export data from Riverflow.riverflow_native table to object storage. You can do so with the following query: SELECT * FROM WRITE_NOS ( ON ( SELECT * FROM Riverflow.riverflow_native ) PARTITION BY site_no ORDER BY site_no USING LOCATION('YOUR-OBJECT-STORE-URI') STOREDAS('PARQUET') COMPRESSION('SNAPPY') NAMING('RANGE') INCLUDE_ORDERING('TRUE') ) AS d; Here, we instruct Vantage to take data from Riverflow.riverflow_native and save it in YOUR-OBJECT-STORE-URI bucket using parquet format. The data will be split into files by site_no attribute. The files will be compressed. In this quick start we have learned how to read data from object storage using Native Object Storage (NOS) functionality in Vantage. NOS supports reading and importing data stored in CSV, JSON and Parquet formats. NOS can also export data from Vantage to object storage.

One option is to wrap your logic in a User Defined Function (UDF). What if you already have this logic coded in a language that is not supported by UDF? Script Table Operator is a Vantage feature that allows you to bring your logic to the data and run it on Vantage. The advantage of this approach is that you don’t have to retrieve data from Vantage to operate on it. Also, by running your data applications on Vantage, you leverage its parallel nature. You don’t have to think how your applications will scale. You can let Vantage take care of it. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a new instance of Vantage the easiest way is to install Vantage Express on your local machine using VMware or VirtualBox. Let’s start with something simple. What if you wanted the database to print \"Hello World\"? SELECT * FROM SCRIPT( SCRIPT_COMMAND('echo Hello World!') RETURNS ('Message varchar(512)')); Here is what I’ve got: Message ------------ Hello World! Hello World! Let’s analyze what just happened here. The SQL includes echo Hello World!. This is a Bash command. OK, so now we know how to run Bash commands. But why did we get 2 rows and not one? That’s because our simple script was run once on each AMP and I happen to have 2 AMPs: -- Teradata magic that returns the number of AMPs in a system SELECT hashamp()+1 AS number_of_amps; Returns: number_of_amps -------------- 2 This simple script demonstrates the idea behind the Script Table Operator (STO). You provide your script and the database runs it in parallel, once for each AMP. This is an attractive model in case you have transformation logic in a script and a lot of data to process. Normally, you would need to build concurrency into your application. By letting STO do it, you let Teradata select the right concurrency level for your data. OK, so we did echo in Bash but Bash is hardly a productive environment to express complex logic. What other languages are supported then? The good news is that any binary that can run on Vantage nodes can be used in STO. Remember, that the binary and all its dependencies need to be installed on all your Vantage nodes. In practice, it means that your options will be limited to what your administrator is willing and able to maintain on your servers. Python is a very popular choice. Ok, Hello World is super exciting, but what if we have existing logic in a large file. Surely, you don’t want to paste your entire script and escape quotes in an SQL query. We solve the script upload issue with the User Installed Files (UIF) feature. Say you have helloworld.py script with the following content: print(\"Hello World!\") Let’s assume the script is on your local machine at /tmp/helloworld.py. First, we need to setup permissions in Vantage. We are going to do this using a new database to keep it clean. -- Create a new database called sto CREATE DATABASE STO AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB -- Allow dbc user to create scripts in database STO GRANT CREATE EXTERNAL PROCEDURE ON STO to dbc; You can upload the script to Vantage using the following procedure call: call SYSUIF.install_file('helloworld', 'helloworld.py', 'cz!/tmp/helloworld.py'); Now that the script has been uploaded, you can call it like this: -- We switch to STO database DATABASE STO -- We tell Vantage where to look for the script. This can be -- any string and it will create a symbolic link to the directory -- where our script got uploaded. By convention, we use the -- database name. SET SESSION SEARCHUIFDBPATH = sto; -- We now call the script. Note, how we use a relative path that -- starts with `./sto/`, which is where SEARCHUIFDBPATH -- is pointing. SELECT * FROM SCRIPT( SCRIPT_COMMAND('python3 ./sto/helloworld.py') RETURNS ('Message varchar(512)')); The last call should return: Message ------------ Hello World! Hello World! That was a lot of work and we are still at Hello World. Let’s try to pass some data into SCRIPT. So far, we have been using SCRIPT operator to run standalone scripts. But the main purpose to run scripts on Vantage is to process data that is in Vantage. Let’s see how we can retrieve data from Vantage and pass it to SCRIPT. We will start with creating a table with a few rows. -- Switch to STO database. DATABASE STO -- Create a table with a few urls CREATE TABLE urls(url varchar(10000)); INS urls('https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:TDC'); INS urls('http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xteradata+merchandise&_nkw=teradata+merchandise&_sacat=0&_from=R40'); INS urls('https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=teradata%20commercial&sm=3'); INS urls('https://www.contrivedexample.com/example?mylist=1&mylist=2&mylist=...testing'); We will use the following script to parse out query parameters: from urllib.parse import urlparse from urllib.parse import parse_qsl import sys for line in sys.stdin: # remove leading and trailing whitespace url = line.strip() parsed_url = urlparse(url) query_params = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query) for element in query_params: print(\"\\t\".join(element)) Note, how the scripts assumes that urls will be fed into stdin one by one, line by line. Also, note how it prints results line by line, using the tab character as a delimiter between values. Let’s install the script. Here, we assume that the script file is at /tmp/urlparser.py on our local machine: CALL SYSUIF.install_file('urlparser', 'urlparser.py', 'cz!/tmp/urlparser.py'); With the script installed, we will now retrieve data from urls table and feed it into the script to retrieve query parameters: -- We inform Vantage to create a symbolic link from the UIF directory to ./sto/ SET SESSION SEARCHUIFDBPATH = sto ; SELECT * FROM SCRIPT( ON(SELECT url FROM urls) SCRIPT_COMMAND('python3 ./sto/urlparser.py') RETURNS ('param_key varchar(512)', 'param_value varchar(512)')); As a result, we get query params and their values. There are as many rows as key/value pairs. Also, since we inserted a tab between the key and the value output in the script, we get 2 columns from STO. param_key |param_value ------------+----------------------------------------------------- q |NYSE:TDC _trksid |p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xteradata merchandise search_query|teradata commercial _nkw |teradata merchandise sm |3 _sacat |0 mylist |1 _from |R40 mylist |2 mylist |...testing We have learned how to take data from Vantage, pass it to a script and get output.

It offloads concurrency considerations to the database by running our scripts in parallel, one per AMP. All you need to do is provide a script and the database will execute it in parallel.

DBS state is 5: Logons are enabled - The system is quiescent, it means that Vantage Express has started. If the status is different, repeat pdestate -a till you get the correct status. Once Vantage Express is up and running, start bteq client command line client. BTEQ (pronounced “bee-teek”) is a general-purpose, command-based client tool used to submit SQL queries to a Teradata Database. bteq Once in bteq, connect to your Vantage Express instance. When asked for the password, enter dbc: .logon localhost/dbc Using dbc user, we will create a new database called HR. Copy/paste this query and run press Enter: CREATE DATABASE HR AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB x Were you able to run the query? Let’s create a sample table and insert some data and query it. We will first create a table to hold employee information: CREATE SET TABLE HR.Employees ( GlobalID INTEGER, FirstName VARCHAR(30), LastName VARCHAR(30), DateOfBirth DATE FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DD', JoinedDate DATE FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DD', DepartmentCode BYTEINT ) UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX ( GlobalID ); Now, let’s insert a record: INSERT INTO HR.Employees ( GlobalID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, JoinedDate, DepartmentCode ) VALUES ( 101, 'Adam', 'Tworkowski', '1980-01-05', '2004-08-01', 01 ); Finally, let’s see if we can retrieve the data: SELECT * FROM HR.Employees; You should get the following results: GlobalID FirstName LastName DateOfBirth JoinedDate DepartmentCode -------- --------- ---------- ----------- ---------- -------------- 101 Adam Tworkowski 1980-01-05 2004-08-01 1 If you intend to stop and start the VM, you may want to add Vantage Express to autostart. ssh to your GCP VM and run the following commands: sudo -i cat > /etc/default/virtualbox VBOXAUTOSTART_DB=/etc/vbox VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG=/etc/vbox/autostart.cfg EOF cat /etc/systemd/system/vantage-express-17.10.service [Unit] Description=vm1 After=network.target virtualbox.service Before=runlevel2.target shutdown.target [Service] User=root Group=root Type=forking Restart=no TimeoutSec=5min IgnoreSIGPIPE=no KillMode=process GuessMainPID=no RemainAfterExit=yes ExecStart=/usr/bin/VBoxManage startvm vantage-express-17.10 --type headless ExecStop=/usr/bin/VBoxManage controlvm vantage-express-17.10 savestate [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF systemctl daemon-reload systemctl enable vantage-express-17.10 systemctl start vantage-express-17.10 If you would like to connect to Vantage Express from the Internet, you will need to open up firewall holes to your VM.

It contains two use cases: Retrieve customer information from Salesforce, and combine it with order and shipping information from Vantage to derive analytical insights. Update newleads table on Vantage with the Salesforce data, then add the new lead(s) back to Salesforce using AppFlow. Amazon AppFlow transfers the customer account data from Salesforce to Amazon S3. Vantage then uses Native Object Store (NOS) read functionality to join the data in Amazon S3 with data in Vantage with a single query. The account information is used to update the newleads table on Vantage. Once the table is updated, Vantage writes it back to the Amazon S3 bucket with NOS Write. A Lambda function is triggered upon arrival of the new lead data file to convert the data file from Parquet format to CSV format, and AppFlow then inserts the new lead(s) back into Salesforce. Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables users to securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. AppFlow automatically encrypts data in motion, and allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security threats. As of today, Amazon AppFlow has 16 sources to choose from, and can send the data to four destinations. Teradata Vantage is the connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics, solving data challenges from start to scale. Vantage enables companies to start small and elastically scale compute or storage, paying only for what they use, harnessing low-cost object stores and integrating their analytic workloads. Vantage supports R, Python, Teradata Studio, and any other SQL-based tools. Vantage combines descriptive, predictive, prescriptive analytics, autonomous decision-making, ML functions, and visualization tools into a unified, integrated platform that uncovers real-time business intelligence at scale, no matter where the data resides. Teradata Vantage Native Object Store (NOS) can be used to explore data in external object stores, like Amazon S3, using standard SQL. No special object storage-side compute infrastructure is required to use NOS. Users can explore data located in an Amazon S3 bucket by simply creating a NOS table definition that points to your bucket. With NOS, you can quickly import data from Amazon S3 or even join it with other tables in the Vantage database. You are expected to be familiar with Amazon AppFlow service and Teradata Vantage. You will need the following accounts, and systems: A Teradata Vantage instance with SQLE 17.0+. An AWS account with the role that can create and run flows. An Amazon S3 bucket to store Salesforce data (i.e., ptctsoutput) An Amazon S3 bucket to store raw Vantage data (Parquet file) (i.e., vantageparquet). This bucket needs to have policy to allow Amazon AppFlow access An Amazon S3 bucket to store converted Vantage data (CSV file) (i.e., vantagecsv) A Salesforce account that satisfies the following requirements: Your Salesforce account must be enabled for API access. API access is enabled by default for Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance editions. Your Salesforce account must allow you to install connected apps. If this is disabled, contact your Salesforce administrator. After you create a Salesforce connection in Amazon AppFlow, verify that the connected app named \"Amazon AppFlow Embedded Login App\" is installed in your Salesforce account. The refresh token policy for the \"Amazon AppFlow Embedded Login App\" must be set to \"Refresh token is valid until revoked\". Otherwise, your flows will fail when your refresh token expires. You must enable Change Data Capture in Salesforce to use event-driven flow triggers. From Setup, enter \"Change Data Capture\" in Quick Find. If your Salesforce app enforces IP address restrictions, you must whitelist the addresses used by Amazon AppFlow. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html[AWS IP address ranges] in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. If you are transferring over 1 million Salesforce records, you cannot choose any Salesforce compound field. Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk APIs for the transfer, which does not allow transfer of compound fields. To create private connections using AWS PrivateLink, you must enable both \"Manager Metadata\" and \"Manage External Connections\" user permissions in your Salesforce account. Private connections are currently available in the us-east-1 and us-west-2 AWS Regions. Some Salesforce objects can’t be updated, such as history objects. For these objects, Amazon AppFlow does not support incremental export (the \"Transfer new data only\" option) for schedule-triggered flows. Instead, you can choose the \"Transfer all data\" option and then select the appropriate filter to limit the records you transfer. Once you have met the prerequisites, follow these steps: Create a Salesforce to Amazon S3 Flow Exploring Data using NOS Export Vantage Data to Amazon S3 using NOS Create an Amazon S3 to Salesforce Flow This step creates a flow using Amazon AppFlow. For this example, we’re using a Salesforce developer account to connect to Salesforce. Go to AppFlow console, sign in with your AWS login credentials and click Create flow. Make sure you are in the right region, and the bucket is created to store Salesforce data. This step provides basic information for your flow. Fill in Flow name (i.e. salesforce) and Flow description (optional), leave Customize encryption settings (advanced) unchecked. Click Next. This step provides information about the source and destination for your flow. For this example, we will be using Salesforce as the source, and Amazon S3 as the destination. For Source name, choose Salesforce, then Create new connection for Choose Salesforce connection. Use default for Salesforce environment and Data encryption. Give your connection a name (i.e. salesforce) and click Continue. At the salesforce login window, enter your Username and Password. Click Log In Click Allow to allow AppFlow to access your salesforce data and information. Back at the AppFlow Configure flow window, use Salesforce objects, and choose Account to be the Salesforce object. Use Amazon S3 as Destination name. Pick the bucket you created earlier where you want the data to be stored (i.e., ptctsoutput). Flow trigger is Run on demand. Click Next. This step determines how data is transferred from the source to the destination. Use Manually map fields as Mapping method For simplicity, choose Map all fields directly for Source to destination filed mapping. Once you click on \"Map all fields directly\", all the fields will show under Mapped fields. Click on the checkbox for the field(s) you want to Add formula (concatenates), Modify values (mask or truncate field values), or Remove selected mappings. For this example, no checkbox will be ticked. For Validations, add in a condition to ignore the record that contains no \"Billing Address\" (optional). Click Next. You can specify a filter to determine which records to transfer. For this example, add a condition to filter out the records that are deleted (optional). Click Next. Review all the information you just entered. Modify if necessary. Click Create flow. A message of successful flow creation will be displayed with the flow information once the flow is created, Click Run flow on the upper right corner. Upon completion of the flow run, message will be displayed to indicate a successful run. Message example: Click the link to the bucket to view data. Salesforce data will be in JSON format. By default, Salesforce data is encrypted. We need to remove the encryption for NOS to access it. Click on the data file in your Amazon S3 bucket, then click the Properties tab. Click on the AWS-KMS from Encryption and change it from AWS-KMS encryption to None. Click Save. Native Object Store has built in functionalities to explore and analyze data in Amazon S3. This section lists a few commonly used functions of NOS. Foreign table allows the external data to be easily referenced within the Vantage Advanced SQL Engine and makes the data available in a structured relational format. To create a foreign table, first login to Teradata Vantage system with your credentials. Create AUTHORIZATION object with access keys for Amazon S3 bucket access. Authorization object enhances security by establishing control over who is allowed to use a foreign table to access Amazon S3 data. CREATE AUTHORIZATION DefAuth_S3 AS DEFINER TRUSTED USER 'A*****************' /* AccessKeyId */ PASSWORD '********'; /* SecretAccessKey */ \"USER\" is the AccessKeyId for your AWS account, and \"PASSWORD\" is the SecretAccessKey. Create a foreign table against the JSON file on Amazon S3 using following command. CREATE MULTISET FOREIGN TABLE salesforce, EXTERNAL SECURITY DEFINER TRUSTED DefAuth_S3 ( Location VARCHAR(2048) CHARACTER SET UNICODE CASESPECIFIC, Payload JSON(8388096) INLINE LENGTH 32000 CHARACTER SET UNICODE ) USING ( LOCATION ('/S3/s3.amazonaws.com/ptctstoutput/salesforce/1ce190bc-25a9-4493-99ad-7497b497a0d0/903790813-2020-08-21T21:02:25') ); At a minimum, the foreign table definition must include a table name and location clause (highlighted in yellow) which points to the object store data. The Location requires a top-level single name, referred to as a \"bucket\" in Amazon. If the file name doesn’t have standard extension (.json, .csv, .parquet) at the end, the Location and Payload columns definition is also required (highlighted in turquoise) to indicate the type of the data file. Foreign tables are always defined as No Primary Index (NoPI) tables. Once foreign table’s created, you can query the content of the Amazon S3 data set by doing \"Select\" on the foreign table. SELECT * FROM salesforce; SELECT payload.* FROM salesforce; The foreign table only contains two columns: Location and Payload. Location is the address in the object store system. The data itself is represented in the payload column, with the payload value within each record in the foreign table representing a single JSON object and all its name-value pairs. Sample output from \"SELECT * FROM salesforce;\". Sample output form \"SELECT payload.* FROM salesforce;\". JSON data may contain different attributes in different records. To determine the full list of possible attributes in a data store, use JSON_KEYS: |SELECT DISTINCT * FROM JSON_KEYS (ON (SELECT payload FROM salesforce)) AS j; Partial Output: Views can simplify the names associated with the payload attributes, make it easier to code executable SQL against object store data, and hide the Location references in the foreign table to make it look like normal columns. Following is a sample create view statement with the attributes discovered from the JSON_KEYS table operator above. REPLACE VIEW salesforceView AS ( SELECT CAST(payload.Id AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_ID, CAST(payload.\"Name\" AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Name, CAST(payload.AccountNumber AS VARCHAR(10)) Acct_Number, CAST(payload.BillingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Street, CAST(payload.BillingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_City, CAST(payload.BillingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Billing_State, CAST(payload.BillingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Billing_Post_Code, CAST(payload.BillingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Country, CAST(payload.Phone AS VARCHAR(15)) Phone, CAST(payload.Fax AS VARCHAR(15)) Fax, CAST(payload.ShippingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Street, CAST(payload.ShippingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_City, CAST(payload.ShippingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Shipping_State, CAST(payload.ShippingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Shipping_Post_Code, CAST(payload.ShippingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Country, CAST(payload.Industry AS VARCHAR(50)) Industry, CAST(payload.Description AS VARCHAR(200)) Description, CAST(payload.NumberOfEmployees AS VARCHAR(10)) Num_Of_Employee, CAST(payload.CustomerPriority__c AS VARCHAR(10)) Priority, CAST(payload.Rating AS VARCHAR(10)) Rating, CAST(payload.SLA__c AS VARCHAR(10)) SLA, CAST(payload.AnnualRevenue AS VARCHAR(10)) Annual_Revenue, CAST(payload.\"Type\" AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_Type, CAST(payload.Website AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Website, CAST(payload.LastActivityDate AS VARCHAR(50)) Last_Activity_Date FROM salesforce ); SELECT * FROM salesforceView; Partial output: READ_NOS table operator can be used to sample and explore a percent of the data without having first defined a foreign table, or to view a list of the keys associated with all the objects specified by a Location clause.

For example, ordering and shipping information are in Vantage in these three tables – Orders, Order_Items and Shipping_Address. DDL for Orders: CREATE TABLE Orders ( Order_ID INT NOT NULL, Customer_ID VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, Order_Status INT, -- Order status: 1 = Pending; 2 = Processing; 3 = Rejected; 4 = Completed Order_Date DATE NOT NULL, Required_Date DATE NOT NULL, Shipped_Date DATE, Store_ID INT NOT NULL, Staff_ID INT NOT NULL ) Primary Index (Order_ID); DDL for Order_Items: CREATE TABLE Order_Items( Order_ID INT NOT NULL, Item_ID INT, Product_ID INT NOT NULL, Quantity INT NOT NULL, List_Price DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL, Discount DECIMAL (4, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 ) Primary Index (Order_ID, Item_ID); DDL for Shipping_Address: CREATE TABLE Shipping_Address ( Customer_ID VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC NOT NULL, Street VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, City VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, State VARCHAR(15) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, Postal_Code VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, Country VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC ) Primary Index (Customer_ID); And the tables have following data: Orders: Order_Items: Shipping_Address: By joining the salesforce foreign table to the established database table Orders, Order_Items and Shipping_Address, we can retrieve customer’s order information with customer’s shipping information. SELECT s.payload.Id as Customer_ID, s.payload.\"Name\" as Customer_Name, s.payload.AccountNumber as Acct_Number, o.Order_ID as Order_ID, o.Order_Status as Order_Status, o.Order_Date as Order_Date, oi.Item_ID as Item_ID, oi.Product_ID as Product_ID, sa.Street as Shipping_Street, sa.City as Shipping_City, sa.State as Shipping_State, sa.Postal_Code as Shipping_Postal_Code, sa.Country as Shipping_Country FROM salesforce s, Orders o, Order_Items oi, Shipping_Address sa WHERE s.payload.Id = o.Customer_ID AND o.Customer_ID = sa.Customer_ID AND o.Order_ID = oi.Order_ID ORDER BY 1; Results: Having a persistent copy of the Amazon S3 data can be useful when repetitive access of the same data is expected. NOS foreign table does not automatically make a persistent copy of the Amazon S3 data. A few approaches to capture the data in the database are described below: A \"CREATE TABLE AS … WITH DATA\" statement can be used with the foreign table definition acting as the source table. Use this approach you can selectively choose which attributes within the foreign table payload that you want to include in the target table, and what the relational table columns will be named. CREATE TABLE salesforceVantage AS ( SELECT CAST(payload.Id AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_ID, CAST(payload.\"Name\" AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Name, CAST(payload.AccountNumber AS VARCHAR(10)) Acct_Number, CAST(payload.BillingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Street, CAST(payload.BillingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_City, CAST(payload.BillingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Billing_State, CAST(payload.BillingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Billing_Post_Code, CAST(payload.BillingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Country, CAST(payload.Phone AS VARCHAR(15)) Phone, CAST(payload.Fax AS VARCHAR(15)) Fax, CAST(payload.ShippingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Street, CAST(payload.ShippingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_City, CAST(payload.ShippingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Shipping_State, CAST(payload.ShippingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Shipping_Post_Code, CAST(payload.ShippingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Country, CAST(payload.Industry AS VARCHAR(50)) Industry, CAST(payload.Description AS VARCHAR(200)) Description, CAST(payload.NumberOfEmployees AS INT) Num_Of_Employee, CAST(payload.CustomerPriority__c AS VARCHAR(10)) Priority, CAST(payload.Rating AS VARCHAR(10)) Rating, CAST(payload.SLA__c AS VARCHAR(10)) SLA, CAST(payload.\"Type\" AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_Type, CAST(payload.Website AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Website, CAST(payload.AnnualRevenue AS VARCHAR(10)) Annual_Revenue, CAST(payload.LastActivityDate AS DATE) Last_Activity_Date FROM salesforce) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; SELECT* * FROM salesforceVantage; partial results: An alternative to using foreign table is to use the READ_NOS table operator. This table operator allows you to access data directly from an object store without first building a foreign table. Combining READ_NOS with a CREATE TABLE AS clause to build a persistent version of the data in the database. CREATE TABLE salesforceReadNOS AS ( SELECT CAST(payload.Id AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_ID, CAST(payload.\"Name\" AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Name, CAST(payload.AccountNumber AS VARCHAR(10)) Acct_Number, CAST(payload.BillingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Street, CAST(payload.BillingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_City, CAST(payload.BillingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Billing_State, CAST(payload.BillingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Billing_Post_Code, CAST(payload.BillingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Country, CAST(payload.Phone AS VARCHAR(15)) Phone, CAST(payload.Fax AS VARCHAR(15)) Fax, CAST(payload.ShippingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Street, CAST(payload.ShippingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_City, CAST(payload.ShippingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Shipping_State, CAST(payload.ShippingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Shipping_Post_Code, CAST(payload.ShippingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Country, CAST(payload.Industry AS VARCHAR(50)) Industry, CAST(payload.Description AS VARCHAR(200)) Description, CAST(payload.NumberOfEmployees AS INT) Num_Of_Employee, CAST(payload.CustomerPriority__c AS VARCHAR(10)) Priority, CAST(payload.Rating AS VARCHAR(10)) Rating, CAST(payload.SLA__c AS VARCHAR(10)) SLA, CAST(payload.\"Type\" AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_Type, CAST(payload.Website AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Website, CAST(payload.AnnualRevenue AS VARCHAR(10)) Annual_Revenue, CAST(payload.LastActivityDate AS DATE) Last_Activity_Date FROM READ_NOS ( ON (SELECT CAST(NULL AS JSON CHARACTER SET Unicode)) USING LOCATION ('/S3/s3.amazonaws.com/ptctstoutput/salesforce/1ce190bc-25a9-4493-99ad-7497b497a0d0/903790813-2020-08-21T21:02:25') ACCESS_ID ('A**********') /* AccessKeyId */ ACCESS_KEY (‘***********’) /* SecretAccessKey */ ) AS D ) WITH DATA; Results from the salesforceReadNOS table: SELECT * FROM salesforceReadNOS; Another way of placing Amazon S3 data into a relational table is by \"INSERT SELECT\". Using this approach, the foreign table is the source table, while a newly created permanent table is the table to be inserted into. Contrary to the READ_NOS example above, this approach does require the permanent table be created beforehand. One advantage of the INSERT SELECT method is that you can change the target table’s attributes. For example, you can specify that the target table be MULTISET or not, or you can choose a different primary index.

Note there’s no address information for this lead. Let’s use the account information retrieved from Salesforce to update newleads table UPDATE nl FROM newleads AS nl, salesforceReadNOS AS srn SET Street = srn.Billing_Street, City = srn.Billing_City, State = srn.Billing_State, Post_Code = srn.Billing_Post_Code, Country = srn.Billing_Country WHERE Account_ID = srn.Acct_Number; Now the new lead has address information. Write the new lead information into S3 bucket using WRITE_NOS. SELECT * FROM WRITE_NOS ( ON ( SELECT Account_ID, Last_Name, First_Name, Company, Cust_Title, Email, Status, Owner_ID, Street, City, State, Post_Code, Country FROM newleads ) USING LOCATION ('/s3/vantageparquet.s3.amazonaws.com/') AUTHORIZATION ('{\"Access_ID\":\"A*****\",\"Access_Key\":\"*****\"}') COMPRESSION ('SNAPPY') NAMING ('DISCRETE') INCLUDE_ORDERING ('FALSE') STOREDAS ('CSV') ) AS d; Where Access_ID is the AccessKeyID, and Access_Key is the SecretAccessKey to the bucket. Repeat Step 1 to create a flow using Amazon S3 as source and Salesforce as destination. This step provides basic information for your flow. Fill in Flow name (i.e., vantage2sf) and Flow description (optional), leave Customize encryption settings (advanced) unchecked. Click Next. This step provides information about the source and destination for your flow. For this example, we will be using Amazon S3 as the source, and Salesforce as the destination. For Source details, choose Amazon S3, then choose the bucket where you wrote your CSV file to (i.e. vantagecsv) For Destination details, choose Salesforce, use the connection you created in Step 1 from the drop-down list for Choose Salesforce connection, and Lead as Choose Salesforce object. For Error handling, use the default Stop the current flow run. Flow trigger is Run on demand. Click Next. This step determines how data is transferred from the source to the destination. Use Manually map fields as Mapping method Use Insert new records (default) as Destination record preference For Source to destination filed mapping, use the following mapping Click Next. You can specify a filter to determine which records to transfer. For this example, no filter is added. Click Next. Review all the information you just entered. Modify if necessary. Click Create flow. A message of successful flow creation will be displayed with the flow information once the flow is created, Click Run flow on the upper right corner. Upon completion of the flow run, message will be displayed to indicate a successful run. Message example: Browse to the Salesforce page, new lead Tom Johnson has been added. Once you are done with the Salesforce data, to avoid incurring charges to your AWS account (i.e., AppFlow, Amazon S3, Vantage and VM) for the resources used, follow these steps: AppFlow: Delete the \"Connections\" you created for the flow Delete the flows Amazon S3 bucket and file: Go to the Amazon S3 buckets where the Vantage data file is stored, and delete the file(s) If there are no need to keep the buckets, delete the buckets Teradata Vantage Instance Stop/Terminate the instance if no longer needed Did this page help?","title":"Connect Teradata Vantage to Salesforce using Amazon Appflow","component":"ROOT","version":"current","name":"integrate-teradata-vantage-to-salesforce-using-amazon-appflow","url":"/current/cloud-guides/integrate-teradata-vantage-to-salesforce-using-amazon-appflow.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","id":"_overview"},{"text":"About Amazon AppFlow","id":"_about_amazon_appflow"},{"text":"About Teradata Vantage","id":"_about_teradata_vantage"},{"text":"Prerequisites","id":"_prerequisites"},{"text":"Procedure","id":"_procedure"},{"text":"Create a Salesforce to Amazon S3 Flow","id":"_create_a_salesforce_to_amazon_s3_flow"},{"text":"Step 1: Specify flow details","id":"_step_1_specify_flow_details"},{"text":"Step 2: Configure flow","id":"_step_2_configure_flow"},{"text":"Step 3: Map data fields","id":"_step_3_map_data_fields"},{"text":"Step 4: Add filters","id":"_step_4_add_filters"},{"text":"Step 5.

The approach this guide explains is one of many potential approaches to integrate with the service. Amazon SageMaker provides a fully managed Machine Learning Platform. There are two use cases for Amazon SageMaker and Teradata: Data resides on Teradata Vantage and Amazon SageMaker will be used for both the Model definition and subsequent scoring. Under this use case Teradata will provide data into the Amazon S3 environment so that Amazon SageMaker can consume training and test data sets for the purpose of model development. Teradata would further make data available via Amazon S3 for subsequent scoring by Amazon SageMaker. Under this model Teradata is a data repository only. Data resides on Teradata Vantage and Amazon SageMaker will be used for the Model definition, and Teradata for the subsequent scoring. Under this use case Teradata will provide data into the Amazon S3 environment so that Amazon SageMaker can consume training and test data sets for the purpose of model development. Teradata will need to import the Amazon SageMaker model into a Teradata table for subsequent scoring by Teradata Vantage. Under this model Teradata is a data repository and a scoring engine. The first use case is discussed in this document. Amazon SageMaker consumes training and test data from an Amazon S3 bucket. This article describes how you can load Teradata analytics data sets into an Amazon S3 bucket. The data can then available to Amazon SageMaker to build and train machine learning models and deploy them into a production environment. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a new instance of Vantage the easiest way is to install Vantage Express on your local machine using VMware, VirtualBox, or UTM. You can also run Vantage Express in the cloud on GCP. IAM permission to access Amazon S3 bucket, and to use Amazon SageMaker service. An Amazon S3 bucket to store training data. Amazon SageMaker trains data from an Amazon S3 bucket. Following are the steps to load training data from Vantage to an Amazon S3 bucket: Go to Amazon SageMaker console and create a notebook instance. See Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide for instructions on how to create a notebook instance: Open your notebook instance: Start a new file by clicking on New → conda_python3: Install Teradata Python library: !pip install teradataml In a new cell and import additional libraries: import teradataml as tdml from teradataml import create_context, get_context, remove_context from teradataml.dataframe.dataframe import DataFrame import pandas as pd import boto3, os In a new cell, connect to Teradata Vantage. Replace , , to match your Vantage environment: create_context(host = '', username = '', password = '') Retrieve data rom the table where the training dataset resides using TeradataML DataFrame API: train_data = tdml.DataFrame('table_with_training_data') trainDF = train_data.to_pandas() Write data to a local file: trainFileName = 'train.csv' trainDF.to_csv(trainFileName, header=None, index=False) Upload the file to Amazon S3: bucket = 'sagedemo' prefix = 'sagemaker/train' trainFile = open(trainFileName, 'rb') boto3.Session().resource('s3').Bucket(bucket).Object(os.path.join(prefix, localFile)).upload_fileobj(trainFile) Select Training jobs on the left menu under Training, then click on Create training job: At the Create training job window, fill in the Job name (e.g. xgboost-bank) and Create a new role for the IAM role. Choose Any S3 bucket for the Amazon S3 buckets and Create role: Back in the Create training job window, use XGBoost as the algorithm: Use the default ml.m4.xlarge instance type, and 30GB of additional storage volume per instance. This is a short training job, shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. Fill in following hyperparameters and leave everything else as default: num_round=100 silent=0 eta=0.2 gamma=4 max_depth=5 min_child_weight=6 subsample=0.8 objective='binary:logistic' For Input data configuration, enter the Amazon S3 bucket where you stored your training data. Input mode is File. Content type is csv. S3 location is where the file uploaded to: For Output data configuration, enter path where the output data will be stored: Leave everything else as default, and click on “Create training job”. Detail instructions on how to configure the training job can be found in Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide. Once the training job’s created, Amazon SageMaker launches the ML instances to train the model, and stores the resulting model artifacts and other output in the Output data configuration (path//output by default). After you train your model, deploy it using a persistent endpoint Select Models under Inference from the left panel, then Create model. Fill in the model name (e.g. xgboost-bank), and choose the IAM role you created from the previous step. For Container definition 1, use 433757028032.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/xgboost:latest as Location of inference code image. Location of model artifacts is the output path of your training job Leave everything else as default, then Create model. Select the model you just created, then click on Create endpoint configuration: Fill in the name (e.g. xgboost-bank) and use default for everything else. The model name and training job should be automatically populated for you. Click on Create endpoint configuration. Select Inference → Models from the left panel, select the model again, and click on Create endpoint this time: Fill in the name (e.g. xgboost-bank), and select Use an existing endpoint configuration: image::sagemaker-with-teradata-vantage/attach.endpoint.configuration.png[Attach endpoint configuration] Select the endpoint configuration created from last step, and click on Select endpoint configuration: Leave everything else as default and click on Create endpoint. Now the model is deployed to the endpoint and can be used by client applications. This how-to demonstrated how to extract training data from Vantage and use it to train a model in Amazon SageMaker. The solution used a Jupyter notebook to extract data from Vantage and write it to an S3 bucket. A SageMaker training job read data from the S3 bucket and produced a model. The model was deployed to AWS as a service endpoint.
