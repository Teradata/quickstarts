== Overview

This how-to describes how to connect to Terdata Vantage from KNIME Analytics Platform.

=== About KNIME Analytics Platform

KNIME Analytics Platform is a data science workbench. It supports analytics on various data sources, including Teradata Vantage.

== Prerequisites

* Access to a Teradata Vantage instance, version 17.10 or higher.
+
include::ROOT:partial$vantage_clearscape_analytics.adoc[]
* KNIME installed locally. See link:https://www.knime.com/installation[KNIME installation instructions] for details.

== Integration Procedure

1. Go to https://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/jdbc-driver (first time users will need to register) and download the latest version of the JDBC driver.
2. Unzip the downloaded file. You will find `terajdbc4.jar` file.
3. In KNIME, click on `File â†’ Preference`. Under `Databases`, click `Add`:

+
image::{page-image-directory}/test-connection-2.png[Test connection step 2, width=75%]
7. Right-click on the `Database Reader (legacy)` to configure settings. Select `com.teradata.jdbc.Teradriver` from the drop-down:
