== Overview
This quickstart details the process for running the https://github.com/Teradata/lake-demos[Teradata Jupyter Notebook Demos for Vantage Cloud Lake], on Microsoft Azure.

== Prerequisites
* Access to a Microsoft Azure account
* https://quickstarts.teradata.com/getting-started-with-vantagecloud-lake.html[Access to a VantageCloud Lake environment]

== Microsoft Azure setup
In this section we will cover in detail each of the steps below:

* Create a Microsoft Azure Web App based on Teradata Jupyter Lab extensions Docker image
* Configure Jupyter Lab extensions Azure Web App
* Load Vantagecloud Lake demos to Jupyter Lab extensions Azure Web App
* Find the IP of the Jupyter Lab extensions Azure Web App

=== Create a Microsoft Azure Web App based on Teradata Jupyter Lab extensions Docker image
* Login to Microsoft Azure and click on APP Services

* In App Services click Web App

image::{dir}/azure-app-service-1.PNG[Create Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

* On the Basics tab:
** Select the appropiate resource group
** Enter a name for your web app
** On Publish select Docker Container 
** Select Linux as operating system
** Select the appropiate region according to your needs
** Select the appropiate App Service plan, if you don't have any a new one will be created with default configurations
** For purposes of the VantageCloud Lake demo redundancy is not needed

* On the Docker tab:
** Select Single Container, the default option
** In Image Source select Docker Hub
** In Access Type select Public
** In Image and tag type `teradata/jupyterlab-extensions:latest`
** A startup command is not needed for this App Service

* Select Review + Create
* Click on Create

=== Configure Jupyter Lab extensions Azure Web App
* Select Configuration on the right panel

image::{dir}/azure-app-service-resource-6.PNG[Create Azure web app Complete,align="center" width=75%]

* Add the following Application Settings

+
[cols="1,1"]
|====
| *Application Setting* | *Value*
| *accept_license* 
| Y
| *WEBSITES_PORT* 
| 8888
| *JUPYTER_TOKEN*
| Your desired Jupyter Lab token, if not added, Jupyter Lab will randomly generate one, requiring perusing the logs, if left blank Jupyter Lab the environment would not be locked
|====

* Click on save, your app will be restarted

image::{dir}/azure-app-service-resource-config-7.PNG[Config Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

* Return to the Overview tab on the right panel

=== Load Vantagecloud Lake demos to Jupyter Lab extensions Azure Web App
* Click on Default domain

image::{dir}/azure-app-service-resource-8.PNG[Config Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

* On the Jupyter Lab start dialogue enter the defined Jupyter token and click Log in

image::{dir}/azure-jupyter-console-auth-9.PNG[Config Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

* On the Jupyter Lab console click on the git icon

image::{dir}/azure-jupyter-console-10.PNG[Config Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

* Copy the following URI in the corresponding field
** `https://github.com/Teradata/lake-demos.git`
* Click Clone

image::{dir}/azure-jupyter-console-clone-11.PNG[Config Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

* On the Jupyter Lab console click in the Lake Demos folder

image::{dir}/azure-jupyter-console-lakedemos-13.PNG[Config Azure web app,align="center" width=75%]

=== Find the IP of the Jupyter Lab extensions Azure Web App
* In JupyterLab open a notebook with Teradata Python kernel and run the following command to find your notebook instance's IP address.

+
[source, python, id="lakedemos_azure_first_config", role="emits-gtm-events, content-editable"]
----
import requests
def get_public_ip():
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return "Error: " + str(e)
my_public_ip = get_public_ip()
print("My Public IP is:", my_public_ip)
----

** We will whitelist this IP in your VantageCloud Lake environment in order to allow the connection
** This is for purposes of this guide and the notebooks demos. For production environments, a more robust networking setting might be needed
** Azure App Service offers, as well, a list of all possible IP addresses that the service might expose. This is under the overview tab

== VantageCloud Lake Configuration
* In the VantageCloud Lake environment, under settings, add the IP of your notebook instance
** A lake environment supports multiple address whitelisting

== Jupyter Notebook Demos for VantageCloud Lake

=== Configurations
* The file https://github.com/Teradata/lake-demos/blob/main/vars.json[vars.json file] should be edited to match the configuration of your VantageCloud Lake environment +

image::{auxdir}/sagemaker-vars.PNG[Initiate JupyterLab,align="center" width=75%]

* Especifically the following values should be added 

+
[cols="1,1"]
|====
| *Variable* | *Value*

| *"host"* 
| Public IP value from your VantageCloud Lake environment

| *"UES_URI"* 
| Open Analytics from your VantageCloud Lake environment
| *"dbc"*
| The master password of your VantageCloud Lake environment
|====

+
IMPORTANT: Remember to change all passwords in the vars.json file.

* You'll see that in the sample vars.json, the passwords of all users are defaulted to "password", this is just for illustration purposes, you should change all of these password fields to strong passwords, secure them as necessary, and follow other password management best practices.

== Run demos
Open and execute all the cells in *0_Demo_Environment_Setup.ipynb* to setup your environment. Followed by *1_Demo_Setup_Base_Data.ipynb* to load the base data required for demo.

To learn more about the demo notebooks, go to https://github.com/Teradata/lake-demos[Teradata Lake demos] page on GitHub.

== Summary

In this quick start we learned how to run Jupyter notebook demos for VantageCloud Lake in Microsoft Azure.
