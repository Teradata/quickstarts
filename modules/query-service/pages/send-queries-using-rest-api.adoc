:description: Send queries using REST API. TeradataÂ® Query Service is a middleware that provides REST APIs for Vantage.
:keywords: query service, teradata, vantage, query, REST API

== Overview

Teradata Query Service is a REST API for Vantage that you can use to run standard SQL statements without managing client-side drivers. Use Query Service if you are looking to query and access the Analytics Database through a REST API.

This how-to provides examples of common use cases to help you get started with Query Service API.

== Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

*	Access to a VantageCloud system where Query Service is provisioned, or a VantageCore with Query Service enabled connectivity. If you are an admin and need to install Query Service, see link:https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-Query-Service-Installation-Configuration-and-Usage-Guide-for-Customers/April-2022[Query Service Installation, Configuration, and Usage Guide].
+
include::ROOT:partial$vantage_clearscape_analytics.adoc[]
*	Query Service hostname and system name
* Authorization credentials to connect to the database

Having trouble with the prerequisites? Contact Teradata for setup information.

== Query Service API examples

When using the examples, please keep in mind that:

* The examples in this document use Python, and you can use these to create examples in your language of choice.
* The examples provided here are complete and ready for you to use, although most require a little customization.
** The examples in this document use the URL `https://<QS_HOSTNAME>:1443/`.
** Replace the following variables with your own value:
*** `<QS_HOSTNAME>`: Server where Query Service is installed
*** `<SYSTEM_NAME>`: Preconfigured alias of the system
+
[NOTE]
====
If your Vantage instance is provided through ClearScape Analytics Experience,<QS_HOSTNAME>, is the host URL of your ClearScape Analytics Experience environment, <SYSTEM_NAME> is 'local'.
====


== Connect to your Query Service instance

Provide valid credentials to access the target Analytics Database using HTTP Basic or JWT authentication.

=== HTTP Basic authentication

The database username and password are combined into a string (`"username : password"`) which is then encoded using Base64. The API response contains the authorization method and encoded credentials.

Request

[source, python]
----
import requests
import json
import base64
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# run it from local.

db_user, db_password = 'dbc','dbc'
auth_encoded = db_user + ':' + db_password
auth_encoded = base64.b64encode(bytes(auth_encoded, 'utf-8'))
auth_str = 'Basic ' + auth_encoded.decode('utf-8')

print(auth_str)

headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': auth_str # base 64 encoded username:password
}

print(headers)
----

Response

----
Basic ZGJjOmRiYw==
{
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': 'Basic ZGJjOmRiYw=='
}
----

=== JWT authentication

Prerequisites:

* The user must already exist in the database.

* The database must be JWT enabled.

Request

[source, python]
----
import requests
import json
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

# run it from local. 

auth_encoded_jwt = "<YOUR_JWT_HERE>"
auth_str = "Bearer " + auth_encoded_jwt

headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': auth_str
}

print(headers)
----

Response

----
{'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_JWT_HERE>'}
----

== Make a simple API request with basic options

In the following example, the request includes:

* `SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfo`: The query to the system with the alias `<SYSTEM_NAME>`.
* `'format': 'OBJECT'`: The format for response. The formats supported are: JSON object, JSON array, and CSV.
+
NOTE: The JSON object format creates one JSON object per row where the column name is the field name, and the column value is the field value.
+
* `'includeColumns': true`: The request to include column metadata, such as column names and types, in the response.
* `'rowLimit': 4`: The number of rows to be returned from a query.

Request

[source, python]
----
url = 'https://<QS_HOSTNAME>:1443/systems/<SYSTEM_NAME>/queries'

payload = {
  'query': example_query, # 'SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfo;',

  'includeColumns': True,
  'rowLimit': 4
}

payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

response = requests.request('POST', url, headers=headers, data=payload_json, verify=False)

num_rows = response.json().get('results')[0].get('rowCount')
print('NUMBER of ROWS', num_rows)
print('==========================================================')

print(response.json())

=== Request a response in CSV format

To return an API response in CSV format, set the `*format*` field in the request with the value `*CSV*`.

The CSV format contains only the query results and not response metadata. The response contains a line for each row, where each line contains the row columns separated by a comma. The following example returns the data as comma-separated values.

Request

[source, python]
----
# CSV with all rows included

url = 'https://<QS_HOSTNAME>:1443/systems/<SYSTEM_NAME>/queries'

payload = {
  'query': example_query, # 'SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfo;',
  'format': 'CSV',
  'includeColumns': True
}

payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

response = requests.request('POST', url, headers=headers, data=payload_json, verify=False)

print(response.text)

== Use explicit session to submit a query

Use explicit sessions when a transaction needs to span multiple requests or when using volatile tables. These sessions are only reused if you reference the sessions in a query request. The request is queued if a request references an explicit session already in use.

1. Create a session
+
Send a POST request to the `/system/<SYSTEM_NAME>/sessions` endpoint. The request creates a new database session and returns the session details as the response.
+
In the following example, the request includes `'auto_commit': True` - the request to commit the query upon completion.
+
Request
+
[source, python]
----
# first create a session
url = 'https://<QS_HOSTNAME>:1443/systems/<SYSTEM_NAME>/sessions'

payload = {
  'auto_commit': True
}

payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

response = requests.request('POST', url, headers=headers, data=payload_json, verify=False)

print(response.text)
----

Response

{
  'sessionId': 1366010,
  'system': 'testsystem',
  'user': 'dbc',
  'tdSessionNo': 1626922,
  'createMode': 'EXPLICIT',
  'state': 'LOGGINGON',
  'autoCommit': true
}
----

2. Use the session created in Step 1 to submit queries
+
Send a POST request to the `/system/<SYSTEM_NAME>/queries` endpoint.
+
The request submits queries to the target system and returns the release and version number of the target system.
+
In the following example, the request includes:
+
* `SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfo`: The query to the system with the alias `<SYSTEM_NAME>`.
* `'format': 'OBJECT'`: The format for response.
* `'Session' : <Session ID>`: The session ID returned in Step 1 to create an explicit session.

== Use asynchronous queries

Use asynchronous queries when a system or network performance is affected by querying a large group of data or long running queries.

1. Submit asynchronous queries to the target system and retrieve a Query ID
+
Send a POST request to the `/system/<SYSTEM_NAME>/queries` endpoint.
+
In the following example, the request includes:
+
* `SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfo`: The query to the system with the alias `<SYSTEM_NAME>`.
* `'format': 'OBJECT'`: The format for response.
* `'spooled_result_set': True`: The indication that the request is asynchronous.

2. Get query details using the ID retrieved from Step 1
+
Send a GET request to the `/system/<SYSTEM_NAME>/queries/<queryID>` endpoint, replacing `<queryID>` with the ID retrieved from Step 1.
+
The request returns the details of the specific query, including `*queryState*`, `*queueOrder*`, `*queueDuration*`, and so on.
