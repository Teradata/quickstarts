== Overview

Regulus JupyterLab supports the following magic commands in addition to the existing Teradata SQL Kernel magic commands. See link:https://github.com/Teradata/jupyterextensions/blob/master/notebooks/sql/GettingStarted.ipynb[Teradata JupyterLab Getting Started Guide].

== %workspaces_config

**Description**: One-time configuration to bind with the Workspaces service.

**Usage**:

[source, bash, id="magic_workspaces_config", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%workspaces_config host=<RPC_Service_URL>, apikey=<Workspace_API_Key>, withtls=F
----
Where:

* host:  Name or IP address of the query engine service.

* apikey: API Key value from the Workspaces Profile page.

* [Optional] withTLS: If False (F), the default client-server communication does not use TLS.

Output:

----
Workspace configured for host=<RPC_Service_URL>
----

== %project_create

**Description**: Create a new project. This command also creates a new repository with the project name in your GitHub account. The configurations are stored in the engine.yml file.

**Usage**:

[source, bash, id="magic_project_create", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_create project=<Project_Name>, env=<CSP>, team=<Project_Team>
----
Where:

* project: Name of the project to be created.

* env: Cloud environment where the project is hosted. The value can be aws, azure, gcp, or vsphere. For the current release, only AWS is supported.

* [Optional] team: Name of the team collaborating on the project.

**Output**:
----
Project <Project_Name> created
----

== %project_delete

**Description**: Delete a project.

WARNING: Running this command removes the GitHub repository containing the objects created using Regulus.

**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_project_delete", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_delete project=<Project_Name>, team=<Project_Team>
----
Where:

* project: Name of the project to be deleted.

* [Optional] team: Name of the team collaborating on the project.

**Output**:
----
Project <Project_Name> deleted
----


== %project_list

**Description**: List the details of the projects.

Use the project parameter to get the details of a specific project. All the projects are listed if you run the command without any parameters.

**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_project_list", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_list project=<Project_Name>
----
Where:

* project: Name of the project to be listed.

**Output**:

== %project_auth_create

**Description**: Create an authorization object to store object store credentials.

You must create the authorization object before deploying the query engine. The authorization details are retained and are included while redeploying the project. Optionally, you can create authorizations manually using the `CREATE AUTHORIZATION` SQL command after deploying the query engine. In this case, the authorization details are not retained.


**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_auth_create", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_auth_create project=<Project_Name>, name=<Auth_Name>, key=<Auth_Key>, secret=<Auth_Secret>, region=<ObjectStore_Region>
----
Where:

* project: Name of the project.

* name:	Authorization name for the object store.

* key: Authorization key of the object store.

* secret: Authorization secret access ID of the object store.

* region: Region of the object store; local for the local object store.

**Output**:

----
Authorization 'name' created
----

== %project_auth_delete

**Description**: Remove an object store authorization.

**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_auth_delete", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_auth_delete project=<Project_Name>, name=<Auth_Name>
----
Where:

* project: Name of the project.
* name:	Authorization name for the object store.

**Output**:
----
Authorization 'name' deleted
----

== %project_auth_list

**Description**: List object store authorizations that are created for a project.

**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_auth_list", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_auth_list project=<Project_Name>
----
Where:

* project: Name of the project.

**Output**:

image::{page-image-directory}/regulus.auth.list.png[List Auth, width=500]

== %project_engine_deploy

**Description**: Deploy a query engine for the project. The deployment process will take a few minutes to complete. On successful deployment, a password is generated.

**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_engine_deploy", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_engine_deploy project=<Project_Name>, size=<Size_of_Engine>, node=<Number_of_Nodes>, subnet=<Subnet_id>, region=<Region>, secgroups=<Security_Group>, cidrs=<CIDR>
----
Where:

* project:	Name of the project.
* size: Size of the query engine. The value can be:
** small
** medium
** large
** extralarge
* [Optional] node: Number of query engine nodes to be deployed. The default value is 1.
* [Optional] subnet: Subnet used for the query engine if there are no default values from the service.
* [Optional] region: Region used for the query engine if there are no default values from service.
* [Optional] secgroups: List of security groups for the VPC in each region. If you don't specify a security group, the query engine is automatically associated with the default security group for the VPC.
