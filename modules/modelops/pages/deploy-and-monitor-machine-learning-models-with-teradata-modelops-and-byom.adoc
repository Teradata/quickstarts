:description: Tutorial for deploying and monitoring a PMML model into Vantage using ModelOps
:keywords: modelops, byom, python, clearscape analytics, teradata, data warehouses, teradata, vantage, cloud data platform, machine learning, artificial intelligence, business intelligence, enterprise analytics

== Overview

This is a quickstart tutorial for people who are new to Vantage ModelOps. In the tutorial, you will be able to create a new project in ModelOps, upload the required data to Vantage, and track the full lifecycle of an imported Diabetes demo model using BYOM mechanisms.

== Prerequisites

* Access to a Teradata Vantage instance with ClearScape Analytics (includes ModelOps)

* Ability to run Jupyter notebooks

include::ROOT:partial$vantage_clearscape_analytics.adoc[]

Files needed

Let's start by downloading the needed files for this tutorial. Download these 4 attachments and upload them in your Notebook filesystem. 

link:{attachmentsdir}/ModelOps_Training.ipynb[Download the ModelOps training Notebook]

link:{attachmentsdir}/BYOM.ipynb[Download BYOM Notebook file for demo use case]

link:{attachmentsdir}/ModelOps_Data_files.zip[Download data files for demo use case]

link:{attachmentsdir}/ModelOps_BYOM_files.zip[Download BYOM code files for demo use case]

Alternatively you can git clone following repos
[source, cli]
----
git clone https://github.com/willfleury/modelops-getting-started
git clone https://github.com/Teradata/modelops-demo-models/
----

Setting up the Database and Jupyter environment 

Follow the ModelOps_Training Jupyter Notebook to setup the database, tables and libraries needed for the demo.

== Understand where we are in the Methodology

== Model Lifecycle for a new BYOM

Download and unzip the files needed, links are at the top of the tutorial. For PMML file you can also download a PMML generated in the training of a GIT model.

* BYOM.ipynb

* model.pmml 

* requirements.txt

* evaluation.py 

* data_stats.json

* __init__.py

Define BYOM Model with Evaluation and Monitoring

* Import Version

* Evaluate

* Review evaluation report, including dataset statistics

* Approve

* Deploy in Vantage - Engine, Publish, Schedule. Scoring dataset is required
Use your connection and select a database. e.g "aoa_byom_models"

* Deployments/executions

* Evaluate again with dataset2 - to monitor model metrics behavior

* Monitor Model Drift - Data and Metrics

* Open BYOM notebook to execute the PMML predict from SQL code 

* Retire


== Summary

In this quick start we have learned how to follow a full lifecycle of BYOM models into ModelOps and how to deploy it into Vantage. Then how we can schedule a batch scoring or test restful or on-demand scorings and start monitoring on Data Drift and Model Quality metrics.
