== Overview

This document outlines the steps for deploying and setting up Teradata AI Unlimited workspace service using Docker. 

You can install the workspace service using:

* <<_deploy_workspace_service_using_docker_engine,Docker Engine>>
* <<_deploy_workspace_service_using_docker_compose, Docker Compose>>

To use Teradata AI Unlimited with the workspace client, see xref::using-ai-unlimited-workspace-cli.adoc[].

== Before you begin

Make sure you have the following:

* GitHub account: If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one at link:https://github.com/[https://github.com/].
* CSP account: You can host the engine on AWS or Azure. 
+

[tabs]
====
AWS::
+
--
Sign up for an AWS Free Tier account at link:https://aws.amazon.com/free/[https://aws.amazon.com/free/]. To set up AWS CLI, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html].

--
Azure::
+
--
Sign up for an Azure free account at link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free]. Install Azure CLI and configure the credentials on the machine running workspace service. See link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli].
--
====

* Docker: To download and install Docker, see link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/].

== Load Docker image and prepare environment

The Docker image is a monolithic image of the workspace service running the necessary services in a single container.

Pull the docker image from link:https://hub.docker.com/r/teradata/ai-unlimited-workspaces[Docker Hub].

[source, bash, id="docker_pull", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
docker pull teradata/ai-unlimited-workspaces
----

Before proceeding, make sure to:

* Copy and retain the CSP environment variables from your AWS Console. 

** AWS: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
+
See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/environment-variables.html[Environment Variables].

** Azure: `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, and `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
+
For information on obtaining environment variables using Azure CLI, see link:https://github.com/paulbouwer/terraform-azure-quickstarts-samples/blob/master/README.md#azure-authentication[Azure Authentication].

* Set the environment variable, `WORKSPACES_HOME`, to the directory where the configuration and data files are located. Make sure that the directory exists, and that appropriate permission is granted. If you don't set `WORKSPACES_HOME`, the default location is **./volumes/workspaces**.

|Local Location |Container Location |Usage

|$WORKSPACES_HOME
|/etc/td
|Stores data and configuration

|$WORKSPACES_HOME/tls
|/etc/td/tls
|Stores cert files
|===


== Deploy workspace service using Docker Engine

Run the Docker image once you've set the `WORKSPACES_HOME` variable.

NOTE: Modify the directories based on your requirements.

[source, bash, id="docker_engine_run", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
docker run -detach \
  --env accept_license="Y" \
  --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" \
  --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" \
  --env AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}" \
  --publish 3000:3000 \
  --publish 3282:3282 \
  --volume ${WORKSPACES_HOME}:/etc/td \
  teradata/ai-unlimited-workspaces:latest
----

NOTE: For Azure, Teradata recommends deploying workspace service using Docker Compose.

The command downloads and starts a workspace service container and publishes the ports needed to access it. Once the workspace service server is initialized and started, you can access it using the URL: http://<ip_or_hostname>:3000/.

== Deploy workspace service using Docker Compose

With Docker Compose, you can easily configure, install, and upgrade your Docker-based workspace service installation.

1. Install Docker Compose. See link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/].

2.	Create a **workspaces.yml** file.
+
NOTE: The following example uses a local volume to store your CSP credentials. You can create a separate YAML file containing CSP environment variables and run the Docker Compose file. For other options, see link:https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/docker/README.md[AI Unlimited GitHub: Install AI Unlimited Using Docker Compose].

== Configure and set up workspace service

Workspace service uses the GitHub OAuth App to authorize users and manage the project state. To authorize the workspace service to save your project instance configuration, use the Client ID and Client secret key generated during the GitHub OAuth App registration. The project instance configuration values are maintained in your GitHub repositories and you can view them on the Workspace service **Profile** page.

First-time users must complete the following steps before proceeding. If you are unsure about your VPC configuration or permissions, contact your organization administrator.

1.	Log on to your GitHub account and create an OAuth App. See link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app[GitHub Documentation].
+
While registering the OAuth App, type the following workspace service URLs in the URL fields:
+
* **Homepage URL**: http://<ip_or_hostname>:3000/
* **Authorization callback URL**: http://<ip_or_hostname>:3000/auth/github/callback

2.	Copy and retain the **Client ID** and **Client secret key**.


To set up the workspace service, do the following:

1. Access workspace service using the URL: http://<ip_or_hostname>:3000/.
+
