IMPORTANT: This product is in preview and is subject to change. If you're interested in learning more about this offering, contact Teradata Support.

== Overview

The AWS CloudFormation template launches, configures, and runs the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy workspace service and JupyterLab on AWS. 
You can deploy the CloudFormation template using one of the following ways:

* <<_deploy_cloudformation_template_from_aws_console, AWS Console>>
* xref::deploy-ai-unlimited-awscli-cloudformation.adoc[]

== Deploy CloudFormation Template from AWS Console

=== Cost and billing

There is no additional cost for downloading the workspace service; however, you are responsible for the cost of the AWS services or resources used while deploying the workspace service and engine.
The AWS CloudFormation template includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, review the Marketplace agreement page.

=== Before you start

Open a terminal window and clone the link:https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/tree/develop/deployments/aws[Teradata AI Unlimited GitHub repository]. This repository includes sample CloudFormation templates to deploy workspace service and JupyterLab.

[source, bash, id="clone_ai_unlimited_repo", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
git clone https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited
----

=== Step 1: Prepare your AWS account

1. If you don't already have an AWS account, create one at link:https://aws.amazon.com[https://aws.amazon.com] by following the on-screen instructions.  
2. Make sure the account deploying workspace service has sufficient IAM permissions to create IAM roles or IAM policies. Contact your organization administrator if your account doesn't have the required permission. See Control AWS Access and Permissions using Permissions and Policies.
3. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS region where you want to deploy the Teradata AI Unlimited workspace service. 
4. Generate a key pair to connect securely to your workspace service instance using SSH after it launches. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances].
+
NOTE: Alternatively, you can use AWS Session Manager to connect to the workspace service instances, in which case, you must attach the session-manager.json policy to the IAM Role. See xref::ai-unlimited-aws-permissions-policies.adoc[]. If you don't require host OS access, you can choose not to use either of these connection methods.


=== Step 2: Subscribe to the Teradata AI Unlimited workspace service AMI

This article requires an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) subscription for Teradata AI Unlimited running on AWS. Contact Teradata Support to obtain a license for Teradata AI Unlimited workspace service.

To subscribe: 

1. Log on to your AWS account. 
2. Open the AWS Marketplace page for Teradata AI Unlimited and choose **Continue**. 
3. Review and accept the terms and conditions for the workspace service and JupyterLab images.

=== Step 3: Deploy workspace service and JupyterLab from the AWS Console

1. Sign on to your AWS account on the AWS Console.
2. Check the **AWS Region** displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar and change it if necessary. Teradata recommends selecting a region closest to your primary work location.
3.	Go to **CloudFormation** > **Create Stack**. Select **Create Stack** and select **With new resources (standard)**.
4.	Select **Template is ready**, and then upload one of the downloaded template files from the Teradata AI Unlimited GitHub repository:
+

* link:https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/tree/develop/deployments/aws#workspaces-template[Workspaces Template]: Deploys a single instance with Workspaces running in a container controlled by systemd.
** link:https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/aws/workspaces.yaml[workspaces.yaml] CloudFormation template
** link:https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/aws/workspaces.json[parameters/workspaces.json] parameter file

If you're using this template, you can use the embedded JupyterLab service or connect to an external JupyterLab instance. When connecting to the embedded JupyterLab service, you must set the appropriate connection address in the JupyterLab notebook (for example, 127.0.0.1), and for external clients, you must set the appropriate public-private IP or DNS name.
5.	Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose **Next**.

In the following tables, parameters are listed by category:

|PrefixList			
|The prefix list that you can use to communicate with the instance.
|Optional
|
|Define at least one of AccessCIDR, PrefixList, or SecurityGroup to allow inbound traffic unless you create custom security group ingress rules.

|SecurityGroup			
|The virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to the instance.

NOTE: If the account deploying workspace service does not have sufficient IAM permissions to create IAM roles or IAM policies, contact your cloud administrator.

6. On the **Options** page, you can specify tags (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack, set permissions, set stack failure options, and set advanced options. When you're done, choose **Next**. 
7. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the template settings. Under Capabilities, select the check box to acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources. 
8. Choose **Create** to deploy the stack.
9.  Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, the Teradata AI Unlimited workspace service is ready. 
10. Use the URLs displayed in the **Outputs** tab for the stack to view the created resources.

NOTE: If you have only deployed the workspace service, you must deploy an interface before running your workload. To deploy the interface locally on Docker, see xref::install-ai-unlimited-interface-docker.adoc[]. You can also use the link:https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/tree/develop/deployments/aws#jupyter-template[Jupyter Template] to deploy a single instance with JupyterLab running in a container controlled by systemd.

Teradata AI Unlimited is ready!
