== Overview

AI Unlimited JupyterLab supports the following magic commands in addition to the existing Teradata SQL Kernel magic commands. See link:https://github.com/Teradata/jupyterextensions/blob/master/notebooks/sql/GettingStarted.ipynb[Teradata JupyterLab Getting Started Guide].

== %workspaces_config

**Description**: One-time configuration to bind with the workspace service.

**Usage**:

[source, bash, id="magic_workspaces_config", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%workspaces_config host=<RPC_Service_URL>, apikey=<Workspace_API_Key>, withtls=<T|F>
----
Where:

* host:  Name or IP address of the engine service.

* apikey: API Key value from the workspace service **Profile** page.

* [Optional] withTLS: If False (F), the default client-server communication does not use TLS.

Output:

----
Workspace configured for host=<RPC_Service_URL>
----

== %project_create

**Description**: Create a new project. This command also creates a new repository with the project name in your GitHub account. The configurations are stored in the **engine.yml** file.

----
%project_create project=<Project_Name>, env=<CSP>, team=<Project_Team>

== %project_auth_create

**Description**: Create an authorization object to store object store credentials.

You must create the authorization object before deploying the engine. The authorization details are retained and are included while redeploying the project. Optionally, you can create authorizations manually using the `CREATE AUTHORIZATION` SQL command after deploying the engine. In this case, the authorization details are not retained.


**Usage**:
[source, bash, id="magic_auth_create", role="content-editable emits-gtm-events"]
----
%project_auth_create project=<Project_Name>, name=<Auth_Name>, key=<Auth_Key>, secret=<Auth_Secret>, region=<ObjectStore_Region>, token= <Session_Token>, role=<Role>, ExternalID=<External_ID>

Where:

* project: Name of the project.

* name:	Authorization name for the object store.

* key: Authorization key of the object store.

* secret: Authorization secret access ID of the object store.

* region: Region of the object store; local for the local object store.

* [Optional] token: Session token for the object store access.

* [Optional] role: IAM users or service account to access AWS resources from an AWS account by assuming a role and its entitlements. The owner of the AWS resource defines the role. For example: arn:aws:iam::00000:role/STSAssumeRole.

* ExternalID: External ID used to access object store.


**Output**:

----
Authorization 'name' created
----

== %project_auth_update
