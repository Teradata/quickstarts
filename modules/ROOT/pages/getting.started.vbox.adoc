. 30GB of disk space and enough CPU and RAM to be able to dedicate at least one core and 6GB RAM to the virtual machine.
. Admin rights to be able to install and run the software.
+
// NOTE: No admin rights on your local machine? No problem! Have a look at how to run Vantage Express in link:#[AWS], link:#[Azure], link:#[Google Cloud].

== Installation

=== Download required software

. The latest version of link:https://downloads.teradata.com/download/database/teradata-express-for-vmware-player[Vantage Express] VM image.
+
NOTE: If you have not used the Teradata downloads website before, you will need to register first.
. link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox], version 6.1.

NOTE: You can also install VirtualBox using `brew` and other package managers.
. On Windows, you will also need link:https://www.7-zip.org/download.html[7zip] to unzip Vantage Express.

=== Run installers

. Install VirtualBox by running the installer and accepting the default values. VirtualBox includes functionality that requires elevated privileges. When you start VirtualBox for the first time, you will be asked to confirm these elevated access. You will also need to reboot your machine to activate a VirtualBox kernel plugin.

Run in Powershell as Administrator:
[source, powershell, role="content-editable emits-gtm-events", id="vm_image_dir_win"]
----
$env:VM_IMAGE_DIR = "$HOME\Downloads\VantageExpress17.20_Sles12"
----
--
MacOS::

[source, bash, role="content-editable emits-gtm-events", id="vm_image_dir_macos"]

export VM_IMAGE_DIR="$HOME/Downloads/VantageExpress17.20_Sles12"

[source, bash, role="content-editable emits-gtm-events", id="vm_image_dir_linux"]
----
export VM_IMAGE_DIR="$HOME/Downloads/VantageExpress17.20_Sles12"
----

====
. We will now create a VirtualBox VM that uses the downloaded image. Run the following command. The script will take several minutes to complete. During the execution, the script will ask for a password to login to the VM and perform some setup. The password is `root`.
