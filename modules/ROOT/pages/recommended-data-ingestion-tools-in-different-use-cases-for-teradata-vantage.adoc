== Overview

This article outlines different use cases involving data ingestion, lists available tools, and recommends the optimal tool for each use case.

=== Ingesting data from external object store
==== Available Tools: link:https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Teradata-VantageTM-Native-Object-Store-Getting-Started-Guide-17.20/Welcome-to-Native-Object-Store[Teradata Native Object Store (NOS), window="_blank"], https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-Parallel-Transporter-User-Guide/June-2022/Introduction-to-Teradata-PT[Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT),window="_blank"]


* *Teradata NOS*: NOS is the recommended option to ingest data from files in object storage. This situation is very common in the cloud and on-prem data fabric systems.

=== Ingesting data from local files
==== Available Tools: link:https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-Parallel-Transporter-User-Guide/June-2022/Introduction-to-Teradata-PT[Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT),window="_blank"], link:https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_Lake_VMware/Basic-Teradata-Query-Reference-17.20/Introduction-to-BTEQ[BTEQ,window="_blank"]


* *Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT)*:  TPT is the recommended option to load data from local files. TPT is optimized for scalability and parallelism, thus it has the best throughput from all available options.  

* *BTEQ*: BTEQ has full scripting capabilities and the ability to read files. It is a good option if it is already the primary ingestion tool used by a customer.

=== Move data from different systems for unified query processing
==== Available Tools: link:https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-QueryGridTM-Installation-and-User-Guide/October-2020/Teradata-QueryGrid-Overview[Teradata QueryGrid,window="_blank"]

*Teradata QueryGrid*: QueryGrid is the recommended option to move limited quantities of data between different systems/platforms. This includes movement within Vantage instances, Apache Spark, Oracle, Presto, etc. It is especially suited to situations when what needs to be synced is described by complex conditions that can be expressed in SQL. 

=== Ingesting data from SaaS applications (Third Party Tools)
==== Available Tools: link:https://airbyte.com/[Airbyte,window="_blank"]

*Airbyte*: Airbyte is an ELT tool that has more than 350 connectors and is Open Source. It's a favored option for conducting lightweight ingestions from SaaS applications into Teradata Vantage.
